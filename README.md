# SmartServ Task 3 & 4.

## Introduction

This project is a basic frontend for a login dashboard with specific functionality. The login page includes validation for the email format in the username field and specific requirements for the password field. Additionally, the project includes a dashboard page with actual components such as charts and dropdowns.


## Functionality

1. **Login Page:**
   - The login page includes fields for the username (email format) and password.
   - The password field is masked for security.
   - Password validation:
     - Should not accept any special character other than `@`.
     - Must contain an uppercase letter and a number.

2. **Dashboard Page:**
   - Entering the password as `SmartServTest@123` redirects the user to the dashboard.
   - Any other password throws an error.
   - Clicking on the "Forgot your password" link opens the default email client to send an email to `support@smartserv.io` for password reset.

3. **Components on Dashboard:**
   - The dashboard page includes actual components like charts and dropdowns.
